This project explores the distribution of labor force participation and unemployment rates among individuals with advanced education across three major world regions:

🇪🇺 European Union (EU)

🌎 Latin America & Caribbean (LCN)

🌍 Arab Countries (ARB)

Using real-world data pulled via an API, the project visualizes and analyzes how educational attainment intersects with labor market trends in different parts of the world. The aim is to provide a data-driven perspective on employment disparities and regional differences.
